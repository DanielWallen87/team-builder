# React Justice League Sign-Up Form

Forms are a common part of any app or website. It's important to understand how they work, because then we can collect data from users that will help us improve their overall experience. 

While this is a simple form, it's also effective (who knew signing up for the Justice League could be so easy?). A spread operator is utilized in combination with useState to collect a new hero's codename and most impressive superpower.

On submission, the hero's codename and power (in the format of an option value specified within TeamForm.js) get displayed on the screen. Please note this form is mobile responsive. Try switching to a cell-phone view and see what happens!

## How the App Works

- Let's pretend you are Aquaman. Type his name into the first input.
- Choose "Speaks to Animals" from the available selections in the drop-down.
- Click the Sign Up button. Lower screen width to 515px or below for a different look.
